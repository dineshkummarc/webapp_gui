h1. Web App Gui

I'm onto the second version of this gui, now redesigned to not resemble OSX too much, as well as a fundamental shift in the way it works. The gui is now designed to work with single page load apps, apps that have most of their view/controller code in javascript, and the models backed by a json providing webapp/server.
